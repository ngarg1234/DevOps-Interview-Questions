Awesome ‚Äî here are **CDK interview questions with detailed answers**, broken into sections so you can prep efficiently:

---

## üß† **Basic CDK Concepts**

### 1. **What is AWS CDK?**
**Answer:**  
AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is an open-source software development framework that allows you to define cloud infrastructure
 using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#. Instead of writing raw JSON/YAML CloudFormation templates,
  CDK lets you write code to define infrastructure, which is then synthesized into CloudFormation under the hood.


CDK Provides contructs (pre-built components) that simplify resource creation.

---

### 2. **Which languages are supported by CDK?**
**Answer:**  
AWS CDK supports:
- TypeScript (primary language)
- Python
- Java
- C#
- Go (experimental)

---

### 3. **What are Constructs, Stacks, and Apps in CDK?**
**Answer:**
- **Construct**: The basic building block (e.g., `Bucket`, `Function`, `Vpc`) ‚Äî reusable pieces of infrastructure logic.
- **Stack**: A collection of constructs representing a single CloudFormation stack.
- **App**: The root of the CDK application; it can contain multiple stacks.

---

### 4. **How does CDK differ from CloudFormation?**
**Answer:**
CDK is an abstraction layer over CloudFormation:
- CDK lets you use loops, conditions, and functions in code.
- CDK apps are synthesized into CloudFormation templates.
- CDK allows better reuse and modularity through constructs.

---

### 5. **What is `cdk init` used for?**
**Answer:**  
`cdk init` is used to bootstrap a new CDK project with the appropriate language template (e.g., `cdk init app --language=typescript`).

---

### 6. **What is the difference between `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy`?**
**Answer:**
- `cdk synth`: Converts your code into a CloudFormation template.
- `cdk deploy`: Synthesizes and deploys the CloudFormation template to AWS.

---

### 7. **What is the `cdk.context.json` file?**
**Answer:**  
This file stores cached context values like availability zones or VPC lookups so that the CDK app doesn't make repeated API calls. It improves performance and consistency.

---

## üì¶ **Constructs & Stacks**

### 8. **What are the three levels of CDK Constructs?**
**Answer:**
- **L1 (CFN Resources)**: Direct CloudFormation resources (`CfnBucket`, etc.).
- **L2 (AWS Constructs)**: Higher-level, opinionated constructs (`Bucket`, `Function`).
- **L3 (Patterns)**: Combine multiple L2 constructs into reusable patterns.

---

### 9. **Can you use constructs from one stack in another?**
**Answer:**  
Yes, you can pass references between stacks using props or stack outputs. CDK handles the cross-stack references automatically via CloudFormation exports/imports.

---

### 10. **How do you share values across stacks?**
**Answer:**  
Pass values via constructor props or use the `ExportValue` and `Fn.importValue` methods. CDK automatically wires them using CloudFormation exports.

---

### 11. **What is a Nested Stack and when do you use it?**
**Answer:**  
A Nested Stack is a stack within a parent stack used to organize resources and avoid hitting resource limits 
(e.g., 500 resources per stack). Use it when modularity and separation of concerns are needed.

---

## üîß **CDK in Action (Use Cases)**

### 12. **How do you create an S3 bucket in CDK?**
**TypeScript Example:**
```ts
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket', {
  versioned: true,
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});
```

---

### 13. **How do you give a Lambda permission to read from an S3 bucket?**
```ts
bucket.grantRead(myLambda);
```
This automatically creates the necessary IAM policy.

---

### 14. **How do you manage environment-specific config?**
Use environment variables, JSON config files, or context values:
```ts
const env = this.node.tryGetContext('env'); // "dev", "prod"
```

---

## üîÅ **CDK + CloudFormation**

### 15. **How does CDK interact with CloudFormation?**
**Answer:**
CDK generates (synthesizes) CloudFormation templates from your code. Then it uses the CloudFormation service to deploy those templates.

---

### 16. **What is an escape hatch?**
**Answer:**
An escape hatch lets you add raw CloudFormation properties when CDK doesn‚Äôt support a specific feature yet.
```ts
const cfnBucket = bucket.node.defaultChild as s3.CfnBucket;
cfnBucket.addPropertyOverride('BucketEncryption', {...});
```

---

## üö® **Security and IAM**

### 17. **How do you define IAM policies in CDK?**
```ts
const role = new iam.Role(this, 'MyRole', {
  assumedBy: new iam.ServicePrincipal('lambda.amazonaws.com'),
});
role.addToPolicy(new iam.PolicyStatement({
  actions: ['s3:GetObject'],
  resources: ['*'],
}));
```

---

### 18. **What‚Äôs the difference between `grantRead`, `grantWrite`, and `grant`?**
- `grantRead`: Grants `s3:GetObject` permissions.
- `grantWrite`: Grants `s3:PutObject`, etc.
- `grant`: Customizable, lets you specify actions.

---

## üß™ **Testing and Best Practices**

### 19. **How do you test CDK code?**
Use the **assertions library**:
```ts
import { Template } from 'aws-cdk-lib/assertions';
const template = Template.fromStack(stack);
template.hasResource('AWS::S3::Bucket', {});
```

---

### 20. **What are some best practices for large CDK projects?**
- Organize code by feature/module
- Use L3 constructs for reusability
- Store configs externally
- Use environment variables/context

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Concepts**

### 21. **What is bootstrapping in CDK?**
`cdk bootstrap` provisions resources needed for deploying CDK apps ‚Äî like an S3 bucket for storing templates and assets (especially for Lambda, CodePipeline).

---

### 22. **How do you handle multiple environments (multi-account/region)?**
Use `env` in stacks:
```ts
new MyStack(app, 'ProdStack', {
  env: { account: '123456789012', region: 'us-east-1' }
});
```
Use `cdk deploy --profile prod` to target specific accounts.

Would you like to continue with **hands-on coding scenarios** or prep with **mock Q&A**? I can also tailor these to Python, TypeScript, or Java depending on your preferred language.

Absolutely! Here are a **few more AWS CDK interview questions**, especially ones that show up in more advanced interviews or involve edge cases:

---

### üîÅ **23. What is `cdk diff` and how is it used?**  
**Answer:**  
`cdk diff` compares the deployed stack with your local code and shows what changes will be made if you run `cdk deploy`. It‚Äôs useful for:
- Reviewing updates before deployment
- Ensuring infrastructure changes are intentional
- Detecting drift or unexpected changes

---

### üß± **24. What are CDK Aspects and how do you use them?**  
**Answer:**  
Aspects allow you to apply operations to all constructs in a scope. They're useful for cross-cutting concerns like:
- Enforcing tagging policies
- Applying security rules

**Example (Tagging):**
```ts
import { Aspects, Tag } from 'aws-cdk-lib';

Aspects.of(this).add(new Tag('Environment', 'dev'));
```

---

### üîÑ **25. How does CDK handle idempotency?**  
**Answer:**  
CDK ensures idempotency by using CloudFormation under the hood. If your infrastructure code hasn‚Äôt changed, CDK won‚Äôt update resources on re-deploy.

---

### üîê **26. How do you manage secrets in CDK?**  
**Answer:**
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store:
```ts
import * as sm from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-secretsmanager';

const secret = sm.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(this, 'ImportedSecret', 'my-db-secret');
```

Use `secret.secretValue` when injecting into other resources like Lambda.

---

### üåç **27. Can you deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions using CDK?**  
**Answer:**  
Yes. You define `env` per stack:
```ts
new MyStack(app, 'ProdStack', {
  env: { account: '123456789012', region: 'us-west-2' }
});
```
Then deploy using different AWS profiles or CI/CD pipelines for each account.

---

### üß¨ **28. What is jsii in the context of CDK?**  
**Answer:**  
jsii is the technology that powers language interoperability in CDK. It allows CDK libraries (written in TypeScript) to be used in Python, Java, C#, etc., by generating bindings.

---

### üèóÔ∏è **29. How do you define a custom construct?**
**Answer:**
Create a new class extending `Construct`, then compose resources inside:

```ts
import { Construct } from 'constructs';

export class MyCustomBucket extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);
    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');
  }
}
```

Use it like this:
```ts
new MyCustomBucket(this, 'ReusableBucket');
```

---

### üßØ **30. What happens if a CDK deployment fails?**
**Answer:**
Since CDK uses CloudFormation, a failed deployment will:
- Roll back all resources created in that stack
- Show errors in the CloudFormation console
- Output logs to the terminal

You can disable rollback using `cdk deploy --no-rollback` for debugging.
