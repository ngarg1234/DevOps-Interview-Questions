Creation Subscriptions .. give a name and that will be attach to your credit card..

Resource Group.. when you provision a resource it asks for a resource hgroup.. you can have many resource group.. may be adavnatage for segregation purpose...

Azure CLI::

first do azure login..

it asks for your microsoft account creds.. 

once loggged in, you can manage azure resources in your azure account using azure cli,....

az group create -l northeurope -n test-resourcegroup

az group list

Azure vs AWS: Resource Group & Subscription Mapping

+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level            | Azure Concept          | AWS Equivalent                                 | Description                                                                              |
+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Top Level        | Management Group       | AWS Organizations / Organizational Unit (OU)  | Groups multiple subscriptions or accounts to apply policies and manage access at scale. |
| Billing Unit     | Subscription           | AWS Account                                    | Billing boundary and isolation unit; owns resources, quotas, and access configs.        |
| Resource Scope   | Resource Group         | No direct match. Closest: Tags / CFN Stack     | Logical container for related resources. AWS uses Tags or CloudFormation Stack.         |
| Access Control   | RBAC (IAM Roles)       | IAM (Roles, Policies, Permissions)            | Role-based access and permission management on both platforms.                          |
+------------------+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Notes:
- Azure Resource Group is required to deploy any resource.
- AWS doesn’t have a mandatory grouping but uses Tags or CloudFormation stacks.
- Azure Subscription ≈ AWS Account in billing/isolation terms.
- Azure Management Group ≈ AWS Organizations (OU) for large-scale management.

Azure Compute Services:

Azure -- Netrwork Security Group - is like AWS Security Group.....

Azure User Data allows u to update the script from outside the VM without stopping or rebooting the VM and can be queried via GET VM/VMSS API with $expand option......

Health Probe is attached to Load balancer.. similar to Health checks in AWS Load Balancer.....

Here, Load balancer creation (after), we need to create the frontend ip configuration too..Scale Sets(Auto Scaling) group needs to be atatched with Backend pools.....


Ah, got it! You're talking about **"backend pools"** in the context of **Azure Load Balancer** or **Azure Application Gateway**, especially when targeting a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** — not DevOps agent pools. Thanks for the clarification!

---

### ✅ **Azure Backend Pool with VM Scale Set**

In Azure, when you're using:
- **Azure Load Balancer** or  
- **Azure Application Gateway**,  

you define a **backend pool**, which is a group of backend resources (like VMs or VM scale sets) that receive traffic.

#### 🔹 For VMSS:
- You associate your **VM Scale Set** with the **backend pool**.
- This enables automatic load balancing across VMs in the scale set.
- Azure can **auto-register** VM instances from the scale set to the backend pool (no manual intervention needed).

Example flow:
```
User → Load Balancer → Backend Pool → VMSS Instances
```

---

### 🟨 AWS Equivalent

AWS uses a similar concept in **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**:

#### ✅ **AWS Auto Scaling Group + Target Group + Load Balancer**

1. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** — equivalent to Azure VMSS.
2. **Target Group** — equivalent to Azure Backend Pool.
3. **Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB)** — equivalent to Azure Application Gateway / Load Balancer.

#### 🔁 Integration:
- You attach the **ASG** to a **Target Group**.
- The **Target Group** is registered with an **ALB/NLB**.
- As instances launch/terminate in the ASG, AWS automatically registers/deregisters them from the Target Group.

Example flow:
```
User → ALB/NLB → Target Group → EC2 Instances in ASG
```

Let me know if you're building this in CDK / ARM / Terraform and need code examples — I can help with that too!

Great follow-up! Let’s break it down — you're asking **why Azure Load Balancer requires a "Frontend IP"** while in **AWS, this concept feels more abstracted or implicit** in the setup. Here's the answer:

---

### 🧩 **What is a Frontend IP in Azure Load Balancer?**

In **Azure Load Balancer** (or Application Gateway), a **Frontend IP** is:

- The **entry point** for network traffic — this is the public or private IP that clients connect to.
- You **explicitly define** this IP configuration in the load balancer.
- It can be:
  - **Public** IP: accessible from the internet.
  - **Private** IP: internal to your virtual network.

You then map this frontend IP to a backend pool via **load balancing rules** or **inbound NAT rules**.

✅ **Why required in Azure?**
- Azure requires you to **explicitly define all layers**: frontend IP → backend pool → rules.
- This gives you **fine-grained control**, which is great for custom setups (but more config-heavy).

---

### ☁️ **AWS Equivalent**

In **AWS**, when you create an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**:

- AWS **automatically allocates IP addresses** for the ALB/NLB in each subnet (called **nodes**).
- You don't have to explicitly configure a "frontend IP" — it's **abstracted**.
- You **get a DNS name** (e.g., `my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`), and AWS handles the IPs behind the scenes.

So even though ALBs/NLBs *do* have frontend IPs, AWS manages this layer for you.

---

### 🆚 **Azure vs AWS: Frontend IP Configuration**

| Feature                      | Azure Load Balancer                     | AWS ALB/NLB                             |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend IP required?        | ✅ Yes (explicitly defined)              | ❌ No (handled by AWS internally)         |
| IP type options              | Public or Private                        | Automatically public or private based on subnet |
| Exposure to end users        | User-defined (IP shown to users)        | Users access via AWS-provided DNS name   |
| Config flexibility           | High (you manage all layers)            | Simplified (less manual control)         |
| Setup complexity             | More manual                             | More automated                           |

---

### 🎯 Why Azure does it this way?

Azure gives **more granular control**, often catering to hybrid network scenarios (e.g., internal load balancer in VNet peering, custom IP ranges, etc.). So the **frontend IP becomes a necessary binding** to determine how traffic reaches the load balancer.

Azure DevOps--

Self Hosted Agent/Private... managed by us..

Microsoft-hosted agents	 -- Pre-configured and maintained by Microsoft. You just choose the image (like windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, etc.). 
                            They are ephemeral—a new VM is spun up each time.
Self-hosted agents	     -- Installed and maintained by you on your own infrastructure (VMs, on-prem, EC2, etc.). 
                            Useful for long-running processes, custom dependencies, or private networks.

When you are using public proect, it can excute unlimited jobs parallelly for self hosted agents.
However, for private, it is single agent.....


Pipeline varibles and variable groups --> it can reused across multiple pipelines......

Service Connection::

You can create a service connection from Azure Pipelines to external and remote services for executing tasks in a Job.Ex. to Azure Subscription for deploying doe to AZure VM,
GitHub Rrpository like that....


An **Azure App Service** is a **fully managed platform** for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, REST APIs, and mobile backends.

Think of it as **“Web Hosting as a Service”** — you just push your code and Azure handles the infrastructure, security, scaling, and patching for you.

---

### 🔹 Key Features of Azure App Service

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multiple language support** | Supports .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, and custom containers. |
| **Automatic scaling** | Scales up (CPU/memory) or out (more instances) based on demand. |
| **Continuous Deployment** | CI/CD support from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. |
| **Custom domains & SSL** | Add your own domain and secure it with HTTPS easily. |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Built-in integration with Microsoft Identity, Google, Facebook, etc. |
| **Staging slots** | Test new versions in staging before swapping to production. |
| **Integrated monitoring** | Built-in logging, metrics, and integration with Azure Monitor and App Insights. |

---

### 🔹 Types of Apps You Can Host

- Web apps (e.g., ASP.NET, React, Flask, etc.)
- REST APIs
- Backend for mobile apps
- Containerized apps (via App Service for Containers)

---

### 🔹 App Service Plan

When you create an App Service, it runs in an **App Service Plan**, which defines:

- **Region/Location** (e.g., East US)
- **VM size and capacity** (CPU, RAM, etc.)
- **Pricing tier** (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium)

> 💡 Multiple apps can share a single App Service Plan.

---

### 🔹 Basic Architecture

```text
You (Code) → GitHub / Azure DevOps → Azure App Service
                                  ↘️
                            Built, Hosted, and Scaled by Azure
```

---

### 🔹 Common Use Case

Let’s say you have a web app built in Node.js:

1. Create an App Service (select Node.js as runtime).
2. Push your code via GitHub.
3. Azure builds it and hosts it.
4. Your app is live at `https://yourappname.azurewebsites.net`.

---

### 🔹 Example: Deploy a Flask App

```bash
az webapp up --name myflaskapp --runtime "PYTHON|3.9" --location "eastus"
```

This command:
- Creates an App Service
- Creates an App Service Plan
- Deploys your local code to it

Let me know if you want help deploying a specific app (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Docker) or integrating it with CI/CD!

Release Pipeline Concepts here below::::::

Pre Deployment Approval....

PostDeployment Approval....

You can have Gates too .. like SonarQube Quality checks.. execute some work item.. or it can be any any thing thing..................

Query work items - If work item is not closed or still in "WIP" stage, dont go ahead with Deployment/Release....

The there is an option where we can tell it to deploy the last succeesfully deployed version (lets say in production), if current release failed.. 

there will make sure we have working version.. Concept name is "Auto-redeploytrigger"

Use Library/Variable Group in Pipelines....

A Task group allows you to group/encapsulate sequence of tasks..

ARM Template contains the following sections:

Parameters: Provides values during deployment that allow the same template to be used with different environments..

Variables: Define values that can be reused in your templates.

User defined functions: Custom function.

Resources: resource we required for our use case.

Outputs: provides output from our resources.

In Azure DevOps Pipelines, We have ARM tenplate Deployment Task already defined by Azure.....

A Deployment Group, is a logical set of deployment target machine that have agents installed on each one.. like dev, prod , qa and testing etc....

then add Deolyment, and then you can deploy it.....

In Azure DevOps, there is a concept of Key Vault to store secrets and generate keys..... and then in varibale it allows you to pull the secrets from Key vaults directly.....
just we need to set up the service connection for connection with azure key vault in Azure DevOps.....
In ARm templates, we can refer the Key vault instead of direct password hardcoding in the codebase....
