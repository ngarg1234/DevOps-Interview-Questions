```

### 17. **Use Session for multiple accounts**

```python
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET',
    region_name='us-west-1'
)
s3 = session.client('s3')
```

---

Would you like this code in a downloadable `.py` file or split into separate files by service?


Yes, if you're working with **multiple AWS accounts** in the same source code using Boto3, you can create multiple `boto3.Session` objects, each with different credentials.

### ✅ Example: Using multiple sessions for different AWS accounts

```python
import boto3

# Session for Account A
session_a = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY_A',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY_A',
    region_name='us-west-1'
)
s3_a = session_a.client('s3')
buckets_a = s3_a.list_buckets()

# Session for Account B
session_b = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='ACCESS_KEY_B',
    aws_secret_access_key='SECRET_KEY_B',
    region_name='us-east-1'
)
s3_b = session_b.client('s3')
buckets_b = s3_b.list_buckets()
```

You can then manage resources across different accounts programmatically.

Would you like an extended version that also assumes roles via STS for better security?


Sure! Here's a clean interview-ready **description + code** bundle you can confidently present when asked about **EC2 automation for cost optimization**.

---

## 🧠 **Interview Answer: EC2 Cost Optimization with boto3 Automation**

> _"To reduce unnecessary AWS costs, I wrote a Python script using `boto3.client('ec2')` that automatically starts EC2 instances during business hours and stops them outside of those hours. This was especially useful for non-production environments like development and testing, which don’t require 24/7 uptime. The script uses local time checks to decide whether to start or stop the instance, and was scheduled to run every hour via AWS Lambda + CloudWatch Events. This helped cut compute costs by up to 70% for idle resources."_  

---

## 💡 **Real-World Use Case**

- **Problem**: Dev/test EC2 instances were left running 24/7.
- **Solution**: Automatically stop instances during nights and weekends.
- **Result**: Saved **~70% monthly cost per instance**.

Example:
- `t2.medium` @ $0.0416/hour  
- 24x7 = $30/month  
- 9am–6pm weekdays only = ~$8/month  
- **Savings: ~$22/month/instance**

---

## 💻 **Python Script (with `boto3.client`)**

```python
import boto3
from datetime import datetime

# === CONFIGURATION ===
INSTANCE_IDS = ['i-0123456789abcdef0']  # Replace with your instance IDs
REGION = 'us-east-1'                    # AWS region
TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Kolkata'              # Your business timezone

WORK_START_HOUR = 9    # 9 AM
WORK_END_HOUR = 18     # 6 PM

# === AWS EC2 CLIENT ===
ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=REGION)

def is_within_working_hours():
    hour = datetime.now().hour()
    return WORK_START_HOUR <= hour < WORK_END_HOUR

def start_instances():
    print("🟢 Starting instances:", INSTANCE_IDS)
    ec2_client.start_instances(InstanceIds=INSTANCE_IDS)

def stop_instances():
    print("🔴 Stopping instances:", INSTANCE_IDS)
    ec2_client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=INSTANCE_IDS)

def main():
    if is_within_working_hours():
        print("⌛ Inside working hours.")
        start_instances()
    else:
        print("🌙 Outside working hours.")
        stop_instances()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
“The if __name__ == '__main__' block ensures that the main logic is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it’s imported elsewhere. This is a common Python best practice to make code reusable and modular.”
---

Yes, **absolutely!** 👇

If your only goal is to **start and stop EC2 instances at specific times**, then **you don’t even need a Python script**. You can:

---

## ✅ **Use AWS CloudWatch Events (EventBridge) + AWS Lambda (No script needed on your local)**

### 🔄 Instead of:
- Writing a time check in Python
- Running your script every hour (via Task Scheduler or cron)

You can do this **entirely within AWS**, using a **scheduled rule**.

---

### 🚀 Recommended Architecture (Simplest Way)

| Task              | Tool               |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Define start time | EventBridge (cron) |
| Define stop time  | EventBridge (cron) |
| Trigger action    | AWS Lambda         |
| Perform action    | Lambda function (using boto3) |

---

### ✅ Example: Schedule Instance Start/Stop

1. **Create an EventBridge rule**
   - **Cron** for start: `cron(30 3 * * ? *)` → 9:30 AM IST (03:30 UTC)
   - **Cron** for stop: `cron(30 12 * * ? *)` → 6:00 PM IST (12:30 UTC)

2. **Create a small Lambda function** to start/stop the instance:
   ```python
   import boto3

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='us-east-1')
       instance_id = 'i-0e278b64e1cf136de'

       action = event.get('action')

       if action == 'start':
           ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
           return 'Started'
       elif action == 'stop':
           ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
           return 'Stopped'
       else:
           return 'No valid action'
   ```

3. **Pass `action` as input** in EventBridge rule:
   - For start rule: `{ "action": "start" }`
   - For stop rule: `{ "action": "stop" }`

---

### 🧠 So, Why Write a Script Then?

> Writing a script with time logic is useful when:
- You want to **manually run it**
- You’re doing **extra logic**, like skipping holidays or checking usage
- You’re just learning how Python interacts with AWS (which is a great learning step!)

---

Let me know if you want help generating the **cron expressions**, or want me to create the full **Terraform/CloudFormation or Python script** to deploy this with Lambda.

## ⏰ **How to Schedule It**

### ✅ Option 1: AWS Lambda + CloudWatch (serverless & reliable)
- Upload script to Lambda
- Set up a **CloudWatch Event rule** to trigger it every hour

### ✅ Option 2: On-prem or EC2-based scheduler
- Use **cron** (Linux) or **Task Scheduler** (Windows)
- Run script hourly or every 30 mins

---

If you'd like, I can also help you format this as a **PDF portfolio piece** or provide a **Lambda-compatible version** of the code. Want that?

Excellent question to anticipate! If an interviewer asks:

> **"Why not just use AWS Instance Scheduler or an Auto Scaling policy instead of writing this script?"**

You can answer strategically like this 👇

---

## 🎯 **Interview Answer: Why a Custom Script Over AWS Instance Scheduler**

> _"That's a great point. AWS does offer a managed **Instance Scheduler** solution, which is ideal for larger, multi-account environments and standardized schedules. However, in our use case, we chose a lightweight Python script for a few reasons:"_

1. **Simplicity**  
   > _We had a small set of EC2 instances (less than 10), and spinning up the full AWS Instance Scheduler with CloudFormation, DynamoDB, and tagging was overkill._

2. **Full Control & Custom Logic**  
   > _The script gave us precise control over timezones, edge cases, and custom schedules (e.g., skipping holidays, staggered stop/start times, logic based on external APIs)._

3. **Faster Setup**  
   > _We could get the script running with `boto3` and CloudWatch/Lambda in under 30 minutes without provisioning extra AWS services._

4. **No Cost or Overhead**  
   > _Using the script with Lambda (or even cron) meant zero additional AWS resources like DynamoDB tables, which the Instance Scheduler depends on._

5. **Easy to Extend**  
   > _We later added Slack alerts and logging to S3 — much easier in a custom script than modifying the managed solution._

For your case (single EC2 start/stop at fixed times):

💡 Use Lambda + EventBridge — it's simpler, cheaper, and easier to control.

🧰 2. AWS Instance Scheduler (Solution from AWS Solutions Library)
💵 Costs
Runs on a CloudFormation stack with:

Lambda

DynamoDB

SNS

EventBridge

So What Is It Then?
It's an AWS-maintained open-source solution built using AWS services (like Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc.) and deployed via CloudFormation.

Think of it as a packaged tool you deploy yourself, not something you just turn on like EC2 or RDS.

✅ Summary
Feature	Instance Scheduler
AWS-native service	❌ No
AWS-supported solution	✅ Yes
Deploy via	CloudFormation (or CDK/Terraform)
Cost	Only for the services it uses (Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.)
Maintenance	You manage updates & config

---

## 🔄 When to Use AWS Instance Scheduler Instead

> _Of course, if you're managing **dozens or hundreds** of instances across environments, AWS Instance Scheduler is a great choice — especially when you need role-based access, multi-account scheduling, and tagging-based logic._

---

💡 **Bonus Tip**: If you're interviewing for a DevOps or SRE role, this kind of thoughtful tradeoff explanation shows **pragmatism and architectural thinking**, not just coding.
