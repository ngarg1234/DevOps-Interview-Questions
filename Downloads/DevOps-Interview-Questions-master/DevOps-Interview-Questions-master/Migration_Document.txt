Here’s a clear and simple explanation:

## ✅ Are **CMF** and **AWS Migration Service** actual services?

**Yes — but they are very different things.**

You are probably referring to:

### **1. Cloud Migration Factory (CMF)**

Often called **Migration Factory**, **AWS Migration Factory**, or **Cloud Migration Factory (CMF)**.
It is **not a single AWS service**, but a **framework / solution / operating model** that automates and streamlines large-scale cloud migrations.

**CMF can be:**

* A methodology
* A set of scripts/tools (often built using AWS services)
* AWS’s open-source **Migration Factory Solution** (sometimes deployed using AWS ProServe)
* A way to coordinate many migrations in parallel

---

### **2. AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)**

This **is an AWS-managed service** used for *lift-and-shift* migrations.
It replicates physical/virtual servers to AWS using continuous block-level replication.

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature       | **CMF (Cloud Migration Factory)**                                            | **AWS Migration Service (MGN)**             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Type          | Framework / methodology / solution                                           | AWS managed service                         |
| Purpose       | Coordinate & automate large-scale migrations (hundreds/thousands of servers) | Migrate individual servers (lift-and-shift) |
| Components    | Can include scripts, automation pipelines, dashboards                        | Uses AWS MGN console + agents               |
| Scope         | End-to-end migration lifecycle                                               | Server replication + cutover                |
| Customization | Highly customizable                                                          | Less customizable (AWS-managed)             |
| Who uses it   | Enterprises doing bulk migrations                                            | Anyone migrating servers                    |

## 💡 How they work together

CMF (the factory) often **uses AWS MGN** under the hood for the actual server migration.

**Example:**

* CMF handles planning, scheduling, tracking, automation.
* MGN handles server replication and cutover.

---

## 🧠 Simple Analogy

**CMF = the entire migration factory (process + automation + orchestration)**
**AWS MGN = the machine inside the factory that moves the servers**

# 🌟 **6. What is AWS MGN & how migration works?**

### **AWS MGN (CloudEndure Replacement)**

Used for **VM migration** (on-prem → AWS).

### **Process**

1. Install **MGN agent** on source servers
2. Continuous block-level replication to AWS
3. Launch **test instances**
4. Fix issues → dry run
5. During cutover, **launch final instances**
6. Move traffic → validate

---

# 🌟 **7. What is AWS DMS & how you used it?**

AWS DMS → Migrates **databases** with minimal downtime.

### **Process**

1. Create **Replication Instance**
2. Add **Source & Target endpoints**

   * Full Load
   * CDC (ongoing replication)
4. Validate tables, row counts, lag
5. Cutover → stop writes → promote target DB
