Here are **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) interview questions** with **clear, simple explanations**, focused on **Kubernetes + general security** (very commonly asked) 👇

---

## 🔹 Basic RBAC Interview Questions

### 1️⃣ What is RBAC?
**Answer:**  
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a security mechanism where **permissions are assigned to roles**, and **roles are assigned to users or service accounts**.  
So users don’t get permissions directly.

---

### 2️⃣ Why do we need RBAC?
**Answer:**  
- Improves security (least privilege)
- Easy to manage permissions
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Scales well in large systems

---

### 3️⃣ What are the main RBAC components in Kubernetes?
**Answer:**  
1. **Role** – permissions within a namespace  
2. **ClusterRole** – permissions across the cluster  
3. **RoleBinding** – assigns Role to user/service account  
4. **ClusterRoleBinding** – assigns ClusterRole to user/service account

---

### 4️⃣ Difference between Role and ClusterRole?
**Answer:**

| Role | ClusterRole |
|----|----|
| Namespace-scoped | Cluster-wide |
| Access only inside one namespace | Access across all namespaces |
| Example: pod read in dev namespace | Example: node access |

---

### 5️⃣ Difference between RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding?
**Answer:**

| RoleBinding | ClusterRoleBinding |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Binds Role to user | Binds ClusterRole to user |
| Namespace-specific | Cluster-wide |
| Can bind ClusterRole inside a namespace | Always cluster-wide |

## 🔹 Medium-Level RBAC Questions

### 6️⃣ What is a ServiceAccount?
**Answer:**  
A ServiceAccount is an identity used by **pods to talk to the Kubernetes API** securely.

---

### 7️⃣ How does a pod use RBAC?
**Answer:**  
- Pod uses a **ServiceAccount**
- ServiceAccount is linked via **RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding**
- Permissions come from Role / ClusterRole

---

### 8️⃣ What is the principle of least privilege?
**Answer:**  
Give **only minimum permissions** required to perform a task — nothing extra.

---

### 9️⃣ Can a RoleBinding bind a ClusterRole?
**Answer:**  
✅ **Yes**  
But access is **limited to that namespace only**.

---

### 🔟 How do you check permissions of a user?
**Answer:**
```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace dev
```

---

## 🔹 Advanced RBAC Interview Questions

### 1️⃣1️⃣ What happens if RBAC is not enabled?
**Answer:**  
Anyone with API access can perform **any action** (very insecure).

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Difference between RBAC and ABAC?
**Answer:**

| RBAC | ABAC |
|----|----|
| Role-based | Attribute-based |
| Easier to manage | Complex rules |
| Preferred in Kubernetes | Deprecated |

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ What verbs are used in RBAC?
**Answer:**  
Common verbs:
- get
- list
- watch
- create
- update
- patch
- delete

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ What are API Groups in RBAC?
**Answer:**  
API groups define **which Kubernetes API** the permission applies to  
Example:
- `""` → core API (pods, services)
- `apps` → deployments, replicasets

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ How do you restrict access to secrets?
**Answer:**  
- Do NOT give `secrets` access unless required
- Use namespace-based Roles
- Use ServiceAccounts instead of users

---

## 🔹 Scenario-Based Questions (Very Important)

### 1️⃣6️⃣ Give a real-time RBAC example
**Answer:**  
> Developer should only view pods in dev namespace

**Solution:**
- Create Role → `get`, `list` pods
- Bind Role to developer using RoleBinding

---

### 1️⃣7️⃣ How do you allow a pod to access S3?
**Answer (Kubernetes + AWS):**
- Use **IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA)**
- Avoid hardcoding credentials
