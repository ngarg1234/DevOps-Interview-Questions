Here are **clean, interview-ready comparison tables** in **easy language**, exactly how interviewers expect 👍

## 🔹 Git Reset vs Git Revert

| Feature                | **git reset**             | **git revert**           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Purpose                | Remove commits            | Undo commit safely       |
| How it works           | Moves HEAD backward       | Creates a **new commit** |
| Commit history         | **Changes history**       | **Keeps history**        |
| Safe for shared branch | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Use case               | Local / private work      | Production / main branch |
| New commit created     | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Risk                   | High (can lose work)      | Low                      |
| Common command         | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | `git revert <commit-id>` |

### 🔑 Simple rule

👉 **Reset = rewrite history**
👉 **Revert = add opposite commit**

## 🔹 Types of git reset (Interview bonus)

| Type                | What happens                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `--soft`            | Commit removed, changes kept staged |
| `--mixed` (default) | Commit removed, changes unstaged    |
| `--hard`            | Commit removed, changes deleted     |

---

## 🔹 Git Rebase vs Git Merge

| Feature                | **git rebase**       | **git merge**             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Purpose                | Make history linear  | Combine branches          |
| Commit history         | **Rewrites history** | **Keeps history**         |
| Merge commit           | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                     |
| Safe for shared branch | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                     |
| Readability            | Clean, straight line | Shows real branch history |
| Use case               | Feature branches     | Main / develop branch     |
| Conflict handling      | One by one commit    | All at once               |

## 🔹 Example (Easy)

### Rebase

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

📌 Feature commits replayed on top of main

---

### Merge

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

📌 New merge commit created

## 🔑 Interview One-Liners

* **Reset vs Revert**

  > Reset rewrites history, Revert preserves history

* **Rebase vs Merge**

  > Rebase cleans history, Merge keeps history

---

## 🔹 When to use what? (Very common question)

| Situation                 | Best choice  |
| ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Undo commit in production | `git revert` |
| Clean local commits       | `git reset`  |
| Sync feature branch       | `git rebase` |
| Release to main           | `git merge`  |
