VPC is always in a region, not spread across regions. If we want across regions use VPC peering..

Elastic IP is static IP.. when you stop your instance and start it, IP changes. ENI (Network Card),
IP is assigned to ENI not to actual EC2.

Elastic IP if not associated with any EC2, then it is chargable..

VPN -- Customer Gateway(customer side), Virtual Private Gateway (AWS side).

ansible jenkins .. aws.... terraform..

VPCs are limited to a region but strechted across Azs.

Subnets can be public or private and are limited to a AZ.
