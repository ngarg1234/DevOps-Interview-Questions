1. What is an ASG?
-> Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is a service that allows you to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in response to changes in demand. It ensures you have the right amount of compute resources available at any given time.

2. What is minimum capacity?
->  Minimum capacity refers to the lowest number of instances that the ASG will maintain to ensure availability, even during low traffic periods.

3. What is desired capacity?
-> Desired capacity is the ideal number of EC2 instances that you want in your Auto Scaling Group. This is the target number, and Auto Scaling will adjust the group size to meet this number.

4. What is maximum capacity?
-> Maximum capacity is the upper limit of the number of instances your ASG can scale out to. It prevents the group from scaling beyond a predefined limit, even under high demand.

5. What are the benefits of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?
-> Benefits include 
    1. improved application availability, 
    2. cost optimization (by adjusting the number of instances based on demand), 
    3. automation, and 
    4. fault tolerance.

6. What is Rebalancing activities?
-> Rebalancing ensures that instances are evenly distributed across availability zones to improve fault tolerance and maintain performance, especially after scaling events or instance terminations.

-> AZ rebalancing and capacity rebalancing
    a. AZ Rebalancing: In circumstances where an Availability Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, the distribution of instances might become unevenly distributed across the Availability Zones. When the Availability Zone recovers, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically rebalances the Auto Scaling group. It does this by launching instances in the enabled Availability Zones with the fewest instances and terminating instances elsewhere.
    b. Capacity Rebalancing: ou can turn on Capacity Rebalancing for your Auto Scaling groups when using Spot Instances. This lets Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempt to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 reports that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption.
 

7. What are the lifecycle of an ASG?
-> The lifecycle of an ASG includes creating, scaling, updating, and terminating instances based on the Auto Scaling policies and triggers.

8. Is it possible to configure lifecycle hooks while creating ASG?
-> Yes, you can configure lifecycle hooks when creating an ASG to control the process of instance launching or terminating by pausing the instance during specific stages of the lifecycle.

9. What are lifecycle hooks?
-> Lifecycle hooks allow you to take custom actions (e.g., running scripts or sending notifications) when instances are launched or terminated in an ASG, allowing for more granular control during the lifecycle of an instance.

10. What is Heartbeat timeout?
-> Heartbeat timeout is the time interval that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for a signal (heartbeat) from the instance before taking the next action (like proceeding with instance termination or continuing with instance creation).

11. What is complete-lifecycle-action?
-> The complete-lifecycle-action command is used to tell Auto Scaling that a lifecycle action (like pausing an instance) has been completed, which allows the instance lifecycle to continue.

What are the lifecycle hook actions? / What is default lifecycle hook action?
Lifecycle hook actions are custom actions like running a script or delaying instance termination. The default action is typically the terminate action when a lifecycle hook expires or completes.

What is the complete lifecycle when enabling lifecycle hook?
The complete lifecycle includes steps such as: 
1) Instance is launched or terminated, 
2) Lifecycle hook is invoked, 
3) Custom action (e.g., waiting for a signal) occurs, 
4) Instance proceeds to its final state after the action is complete.

command is setting up a lifecycle hook in your Auto Scaling group, but it doesn't specify any scripts or actions to run automatically. Let's break down what this command is actually doing:

Breakdown of the Command
bash
Copy
aws autoscaling put-lifecycle-hook \
    --lifecycle-hook-name "MyLifecycleHook" \
    --auto-scaling-group-name "MyAutoScalingGroup" \
    --lifecycle-transition "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING" \
    --notification-target-arn "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic" \
    --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/lifecycle-hook-role"
aws autoscaling put-lifecycle-hook: This is the AWS CLI command that creates or updates a lifecycle hook in your Auto Scaling group.

--lifecycle-hook-name "MyLifecycleHook": Specifies the name of the lifecycle hook. This is a unique identifier for the hook in your Auto Scaling group.

--auto-scaling-group-name "MyAutoScalingGroup": This specifies the Auto Scaling group to which the lifecycle hook will apply.

--lifecycle-transition "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING": This tells AWS that the lifecycle hook should be triggered when an EC2 instance is launching (i.e., when an instance is being added to the Auto Scaling group). You can also use "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING" if the lifecycle hook should trigger during instance termination.

--notification-target-arn "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:sns-topic": This specifies an SNS topic ARN where the lifecycle hook will send notifications about the lifecycle event. In this case, once the lifecycle hook is triggered, AWS will send a notification to the specified SNS topic. The notification can be used to trigger other processes, such as executing scripts, but no direct script execution is defined in this command.

--role-arn "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/lifecycle-hook-role": This IAM role allows AWS to publish notifications to the SNS topic (or to invoke other AWS services) as part of the lifecycle hook process. The role grants AWS Auto Scaling the necessary permissions.

What This Command Does:
Sets up the Lifecycle Hook: The command configures a lifecycle hook for your Auto Scaling group. It doesn't specify any script or action to be executed directly by the hook itself. Instead, the hook simply pauses the instance at the "launching" state until further instructions are given.

Notification Mechanism: When the lifecycle hook is triggered (for example, when an EC2 instance is about to be launched into the Auto Scaling group), an SNS notification will be sent to the specified topic. This is where the action happens, not directly in the lifecycle hook.

What Happens Next?
Custom Action via SNS: Once the SNS notification is triggered, you can have a subscriber (such as an AWS Lambda function, an EC2 instance, or a custom script) subscribed to that SNS topic. This subscriber can execute custom actions, like running scripts, performing configuration tasks on the instance, or sending messages to other systems.

For example, if you want to run a script to configure the instance before it starts serving traffic, you could subscribe an AWS Lambda function to that SNS topic. This Lambda function could then trigger the script you want to execute.

Example of Triggering a Script Using Lambda:
Create an SNS topic and subscribe a Lambda function to it.

When the lifecycle hook triggers, the SNS topic will publish a message.

The Lambda function (subscribed to the SNS topic) can execute whatever actions you need, such as calling a script to configure the EC2 instance.

Why No Script Is Triggered Here
The command itself only configures the lifecycle hook and its notification mechanism; it doesn't define what happens once the lifecycle event occurs. To trigger a script or action, you would need to use an external service (like Lambda, EC2, or Systems Manager) to handle the notification sent by the SNS topic.

In Summary:
This command sets up the lifecycle hook to pause EC2 instances during launching.

It configures SNS notifications to be sent when the lifecycle hook is triggered.

However, no script or action is executed as part of this specific command. You must set up additional resources (like a Lambda function or another process) to respond to the SNS notification and execute the desired actions (e.g., running a script).

Difference between launch template and launch configuration?
Launch templates are more flexible and allow for versioning, whereas launch configurations are static and cannot be modified once created. Launch templates also allow advanced options like setting key pairs or instance types.

What is warm pools?
Warm Pools are sets of EC2 instances that are pre-warmed and ready to be added to an Auto Scaling Group when needed, which reduces the scaling time.

How to use multiple launch templates?
You can use multiple launch templates by specifying them when creating or updating an ASG to allow for greater flexibility in instance configurations.

How to set up mixed instance types?
Mixed instance types allow you to use a combination of On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances by specifying a list of instance types and sizes in your launch template or configuration.

How to use spot instances?
Spot instances can be used by defining a mixed instance policy within your Auto Scaling Group that includes both On-Demand and Spot instances, helping reduce costs.

What is an instance refresh?
Instance refresh allows you to update or replace instances in an ASG to apply changes, such as a new AMI or a launch template version.

What are the Instance replacement methods while doing an instance refresh?
Instance replacement methods can include rolling (replacing instances gradually) or parallel (replacing multiple instances simultaneously).

What is Minimum healthy percentage?
The minimum healthy percentage specifies the minimum percentage of healthy instances that must be maintained in the ASG during scaling activities.

What are the scaling policies?
Scaling policies define how Auto Scaling should adjust the number of instances in an ASG, based on metrics like CPU usage, memory, etc.

What is Target Tracking policy?
Target tracking automatically adjusts the number of instances to maintain a target metric value (e.g., keeping average CPU utilization at 50%).

In case of Target tracking policy, what happens if the number of instances touches maximum capacity?
If the number of instances reaches the maximum capacity, Auto Scaling will stop adding instances even if the metric (e.g., CPU usage) continues to indicate the need for more resources.

What is cool down period?
The cool down period is the time that Auto Scaling waits after scaling activity before making additional scaling decisions to allow previous actions to take effect.

What is scheduled action?
Scheduled actions allow you to scale your ASG at a specific time, either up or down, based on predicted demand.

What is predictive scaling?
Predictive scaling uses machine learning to predict future traffic patterns and automatically adjusts the capacity of the ASG to handle forecasted changes in demand.

What is simple and step scaling?
Simple scaling adjusts the group size by a specific amount based on a threshold. Step scaling allows more granular scaling, where different thresholds trigger different scaling actions.

How to use multiple instance types?
You can use multiple instance types in a mixed instance policy, where you specify multiple instance types and sizes for your Auto Scaling group.

How to enable spot instance?
To enable Spot Instances, you would select Spot as part of your ASG’s mixed instance policy, along with a maximum price per instance.

What is health check grace period?
The health check grace period is the time Auto Scaling waits before performing health checks on newly launched instances.

What are Instance maintenance policies?
Instance maintenance policies define how to handle scheduled maintenance events (e.g., system updates) for instances in an ASG.

What is Instance scale-in protection?
Scale-in protection prevents an instance from being terminated during a scale-in event, useful for critical instances that you don't want to lose.

What is Instance warmup?
Instance warmup is the period Auto Scaling waits after launching or terminating an instance to ensure it's fully operational before taking further scaling actions.

What is Skip matching?
Skip matching allows an Auto Scaling group to skip the matching process when selecting instances during scaling activities, for example, during instance refreshes.

What is auto rollback of instance refresh?
Auto rollback ensures that if a problem occurs during an instance refresh (e.g., new instances fail health checks), the ASG automatically reverts to the previous configuration.
What is the use of checkpoint in case of instance refresh?
Checkpoint is used to save progress during instance refresh operations, ensuring that Auto Scaling can resume from the last successful state in case of an interruption.
What is the default setting and value of checkpoint?
The default value for checkpoints is disabled (no checkpoints saved), but you can enable it when performing instance refresh to allow rollback.
How to stop instance refresh?
You can stop an instance refresh by using the stop-instance-refresh command or the console to cancel the ongoing refresh.
How to roll back an instance refresh?
You can rollback an instance refresh via the AWS Management Console or CLI by stopping the refresh or reverting the changes to the previous configuration.
What are the instance states in which a health check considers it as unhealthy?
Health checks consider instances unhealthy if they are in the terminated or stopped state, or if they fail the health check criteria (e.g., failing to respond to HTTP requests).
How to view the reason for health check failures?
The reason for health check failures can be viewed in the Auto Scaling or EC2 instance details in the AWS Console, which shows the status and any error messages.
What is scale-in cool down?
Scale-in cool down is the waiting period after a scale-in event to prevent Auto Scaling from terminating instances too quickly.
What is Instance scale-in protection?
Instance scale-in protection prevents an instance from being terminated during scaling down events, ensuring critical instances are preserved.
Specifying subnet for launch template?
When creating a launch template, you can specify a subnet under network configuration, which determines the VPC and subnet in which the instances will be launched.
Horizontal vs Vertical scaling?
Horizontal scaling involves adding or removing instances to meet demand, while vertical scaling involves upgrading or downgrading an instance’s hardware resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
What is IAM instance profile?
An IAM instance profile is an IAM role that grants permissions to EC2 instances to access other AWS services, like S3 or DynamoDB.
Placement group?
A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone to ensure high network throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance.


Benefits of IAM Instance Profiles
Security: You don’t need to hard-code credentials (e.g., access keys or secret keys) into your EC2 instances. The permissions are automatically handled by the IAM role and securely assumed by the instance at runtime.

Centralized Management: You can manage permissions centrally using IAM roles, making it easier to update and audit permissions, as opposed to managing credentials on each instance individually.

Temporary Credentials: AWS uses temporary security credentials (via the role) for the instance. These credentials are automatically rotated and expire, further enhancing security.

Simplification: Using IAM roles via instance profiles simplifies the management of permissions for your EC2 instances, allowing for secure communication with other AWS services without manual credential management.

Example: Creating an IAM Role and Instance Profile for EC2 Access to S3
Create the IAM Role:

Go to the IAM console.

Choose Roles > Create Role.

Select EC2 as the trusted entity (because this role is for an EC2 instance).

Attach a policy that allows access to S3 (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess).

Name the role (e.g., EC2S3AccessRole).

Attach the Role to an EC2 Instance:

When launching an EC2 instance, you can select the role you just created (e.g., EC2S3AccessRole) from the IAM role dropdown during the instance setup.

AWS will automatically create an instance profile with the same name as the role and associate it with the EC2 instance.

Access S3 from EC2:

Once the EC2 instance is running, it can access S3 based on the permissions granted in the IAM role.

For example, the instance can use the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI to access S3 without needing to provide explicit credentials.

Conclusion
An IAM instance profile is the means by which an EC2 instance assumes an IAM role to gain access to AWS resources. By attaching an instance profile to an EC2 instance, you can securely grant it permissions to interact with AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and more, without needing to manage long-term credentials on the instance. This approach is much safer and more scalable than managing individual access keys.

Scaling Policies in AWS Auto Scaling
In AWS, Auto Scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your application based on demand. Scaling policies define how AWS Auto Scaling should increase or decrease the number of instances when scaling events occur. The scaling policies are tied to Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) and can be used to adjust capacity based on CloudWatch alarms, custom metrics, or predefined rules.

There are three primary types of scaling policies in AWS Auto Scaling:

Simple Scaling Policy:

Description: This policy adjusts the size of your Auto Scaling group based on a single CloudWatch alarm. When the alarm threshold is breached, the scaling action (like adding or removing instances) is triggered. After the scaling action is completed, Auto Scaling waits for a cooldown period before another scaling action can be taken.

Use Case: This is useful for scenarios where you want to scale in or out based on specific threshold conditions (e.g., CPU utilization) and then wait for a cooldown period before triggering another action.

Step Scaling Policy:

Description: A step scaling policy adjusts the capacity of your Auto Scaling group in increments based on CloudWatch alarm thresholds. You define a set of scaling steps that specify how the group should scale depending on the severity of the metric breach. For example, you can scale out by 2 instances if CPU utilization goes over 70%, but scale out by 5 instances if CPU utilization exceeds 90%.

Use Case: This is useful when you want more granular control over how the Auto Scaling group responds to different levels of load. For example, under light load, you might want to add a small number of instances, while under heavy load, you might want to add a larger number.

Target Tracking Scaling Policy:

Description: A Target Tracking Scaling Policy automatically adjusts the number of instances to maintain a target value for a specific metric, such as CPU utilization or request count. It works similarly to a thermostat, adjusting the capacity to keep the metric at a desired level.

Use Case: This is ideal for maintaining a desired performance level or metric, like keeping average CPU utilization at 50% or maintaining the average response time of your web servers.

Target Tracking Policy
A Target Tracking Scaling Policy is a specific type of scaling policy in which Auto Scaling adjusts the number of instances in your Auto Scaling group to maintain a specific target value for a particular metric (e.g., CPU utilization, request count, or custom metrics). The goal is to automatically adjust capacity based on the metric's performance, ensuring the application remains responsive without over-provisioning or under-provisioning resources.

Key Characteristics of Target Tracking Policy:
Goal-Oriented: You specify a target value for a metric (e.g., "keep the CPU utilization at 50%").

Automatic Adjustments: AWS Auto Scaling continuously monitors the metric and adjusts the number of instances in your ASG to bring the metric closer to the target value.

Continuous Monitoring: The system constantly checks the metric and takes action when the metric deviates from the target.

No Manual Scaling Steps: Unlike step or simple scaling, where you define specific scaling actions (e.g., adding 1 or 2 instances), the target tracking policy automatically adjusts the number of instances to meet the target. You do not need to specify how much to scale in or out.

How Target Tracking Works:
AWS Auto Scaling uses a CloudWatch metric (e.g., CPU utilization, request count, etc.) to monitor the health of your Auto Scaling group.

You set a target value for the metric (e.g., "keep CPU utilization at 50%").

When the metric goes above or below the target value, AWS Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances in the Auto Scaling group to bring the metric closer to the target value.

Example Use Case:
If you have an Auto Scaling group running EC2 instances that are serving web requests, and you want to maintain a constant response time, you could set a target tracking policy to keep the average CPU utilization of your instances at 50%.

When the average CPU utilization rises above 50% (indicating high load), Auto Scaling will add more EC2 instances.

If the CPU utilization drops below 50% (indicating low load), Auto Scaling will terminate some instances to save costs.

How to Create a Target Tracking Policy:
Here’s how you can set up a target tracking scaling policy via the AWS Management Console:

Go to the Auto Scaling Group:

In the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2 > Auto Scaling Groups.

Choose the Auto Scaling Group:

Select the Auto Scaling group for which you want to create the scaling policy.

Create the Scaling Policy:

In the Auto Scaling group details, go to the Scaling Policies tab and choose Create a scaling policy.

Choose the Policy Type:

Select Target tracking scaling policy.

Select the Metric and Target:

Choose the metric (e.g., Average CPU utilization).

Set the Target value (e.g., 50%).

Configure Additional Settings:

Optionally, set a cooldown period to allow Auto Scaling time to stabilize before another scaling action occurs.

Review and save the policy.

Benefits of Target Tracking Scaling Policies
Simplicity: You don’t have to manually configure thresholds and step actions. AWS automatically adjusts the number of instances to keep the metric at your desired target.

Efficiency: It ensures that the system is always operating at the right size, adjusting automatically as demand fluctuates.

Cost Management: Since the scaling is based on actual demand, it helps in optimizing costs by only running the number of instances needed to meet the target performance.

Works with Multiple Metrics: You can use both AWS-defined metrics (like CPU utilization) or custom metrics (like request count or latency) to create the target.

Example: Target Tracking Scaling Policy for CPU Utilization
Let’s say you have an Auto Scaling group running web servers, and you want to keep the average CPU utilization of the instances at 60%. You would create a target tracking policy as follows:

Metric: CPU utilization

Target: 60%

Action: If CPU utilization exceeds 60%, scale out (add more instances); if CPU utilization drops below 60%, scale in (remove instances).

AWS Auto Scaling will continuously monitor the CPU utilization and automatically scale the number of instances to keep the average utilization at 60%. If demand increases, more instances will be added, and if demand decreases, instances will be removed.

Conclusion
Scaling policies in AWS Auto Scaling define how and when EC2 instances should be added or removed based on demand. Target Tracking Scaling Policies are a powerful and efficient way to automatically adjust the number of instances to maintain a desired target for a particular metric, like CPU utilization or request count, without having to manually configure thresholds or scaling actions. This ensures that your infrastructure dynamically adapts to changes in traffic or workload, maintaining optimal performance and cost efficiency.
